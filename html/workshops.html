      <h2>workshop-10 points</h2>

        <p>as this is a studio class, stduents (individually or paired) will contribute to the class's practical and creative skill set by facilitaing a workshop for the whole class. Consider topics/techniques that are engaging, useful and hopefully even inspiring. Workshops will provide active methods for us to sample new techniques,<br>learn about each other and consider creative ways to work together<br>toward a unified outcome</p>

        <h2>workshops can include:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>sharing a method that is integral to your practice that you think will benefit others</li>
            <li>demonstrating a complex technique with some interactive or hands-on components</li>
            <li>coordinating a workshop or demonstration led by a third party</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>workshops should not:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>be so basic that we likely already have the skill</li>
          <li>require (costly) propriety software/hardware that is not readily available on the UCD campus</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>guidelines:</h2>
        <ul style="width:5.75in;">
            <li>workshops/demos should last between 1.25 and 2 hours (if yours will take less or more time, please let glenda know in advance so the class be planned in advance)</li>
            <li>bring all materials necessary for a successful experience (if purchases are required, talk to glenda in advance regarding reimbursements)</li>
            <li>consider all aspects needed, including reserving workspaces, securing required equipment, etc (and of course bring questions to glenda)</li>
            <li><em>optional (and desirable): </em>email glenda a zipped file with workshop materials, such as visual presentations, template files, instructions, etc, so the class can access the materials afterwards (glenda will link to the files from the name of your workshop in the schedule page)</li>
        </ul>
