    <p>when starting on a project, it is worthwhile to survey comparable projects,
noting their assets and deficits in a compare and contrast style</p>

<p>conduct preliminary research through comparative analysis (this could mean <em>form</em>, <em>content</em>, or both)</p>

    <p>locate and critically evaluate two (or more) projects that relate to the class project</p>

    <p>prepare a visual presentation with your research to share with the class. presentations are three to five minutes</p>

    <p>title your file in the following format: <em>lastName_firstName_r1</em> and email the file by 10pm the night before your presentation, or bring it on a thumb drive to give glenda at the start of the class</p>

    <p>note: it is fine if your research process makes more sense using a different method, but please communicate with glenda in advance for glenda's best class preparation</p>
