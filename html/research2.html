      <p><b style="color:orange;">research 2</b> includes a one page brainstorm, identification of target audience and audience research</p>

        <p><b>1. brainstorm</b> your topic in any way that you choose by creating at least one page of idea generation. all brainstorming techniques are valid (including listing, diagramming, doodling, sketching, mapping, etc); the goal is at least one full page of visual/written thinking on your topic without critical judgment...<em>let your ideas flow</em></p>

        <p><b>2. identify</b> a target audience for your project</p>

        <p><b>3. create</b> one or two audience personas with image/s. audience research is an important process activity that helps build understanding and empathy for the users/viewers of your project. audience research can take many forms including demographic research and surveys. research is generally compiled into fictional personas (with an image) that serve to represent the goals and behaviors of a hypothesized group of users. consider the following details: age, occupation, geographic location, hobbies, media interests, media access, styles of attraction, political leanings, attraction to new and old media, time of day audience will use project, location where audience will use project (think behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and environment). read more about personas here: <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2015/10/28/3-ux-principles-that-will-make-you-a-better-content-marketer/" target="_blank">https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2015/10/28/3-ux-principles-that-will-make-you-a-better-content-marketer/</a></p>

        <p><b>4. combine</b> your brainstorm, target audience identification and audience research into a presentation and title your file in the following format: <em>lastName_firstName_r2</em>. your presentation should be approximately 2 min. email the file by 10pm the night before your presentation, or bring it on a thumb drive to give glenda at the start of the class</p>

        <p><b>note:</b> even though you will ultimately work collaboratively (with at least one partner) on your project, research 2 is to be completed individually</p>

        <p><b>and another note!:</b> it is fine if your research process makes more sense using a different method, but please communicate with glenda in advance for glenda's best class preparation</p>
