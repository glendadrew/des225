        <p>Prepare a 5 minute introduction of yourself, <br>your design work and your MFA goals</p>

        <p>You may use any presentation format that you prefer, so long as you bring your files on a thumb drive and they will work on my Mac (I have Keynote, Powerpoint, PDF…). Alternately, you may email me a copy of your presentation by 10pm the evening before the class</p>

        <p>Title your presentation in the following format: <em>lastName_firstName.extension</em>, so mine would be <em>drew_glenda.key</em></p>

        <p>Make sure to practice your presentation ahead of time <br>and do not exceed the 5 minute time limit</p>

        <p><em>Do not rely on an internet connection to show your slides…so if you make them using an online program (such as Prezi or Google Slides), make sure to download a copy before the class meeting and have all files available on your thumb drive</em></p>
